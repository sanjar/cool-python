- Python code is placed in *.py files called modules

- Modules can be executed directly with :
		py module_name.py
		
- Modules can be imported in the REPL or in other module using:
		import module_name
		
- Named Functions are defined with the def keyword, eg:
		def function_name(arg1,argn):
		
- Return statement from function is optional.

- Default return is None.

- Use __name__ to determine how the module is being executed.(directly py or by importing)

- if __name__=='__main__' then the module is being executed.

- Module code is executed exactly once, on first import

- Command line arguments are accesible through sys.argv

- sys.argv[0] is the filename.

- Docstrings are the standalone literal string as the first statement of a function or module.

- Docstring are delimited by triple quotes.

- Docstring provide help(module_name)

- Comments begin with #.

- A special comment on the first line beginning #! controls module execution by the program loader/intepreter.
